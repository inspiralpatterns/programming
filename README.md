# programming
In this repository, some simple programming examples are given. Particularly, the scripts range from a specific musical and artistic purpose (see *SuperCollider* folder) to a scientific purpose (see *Python* folder). 

All these scripts take place in some self-study and online courses I went through aside from my Bachelor and my Master programmes.

The folder is updated as new scripts take place inside.

## general overview
Inside this repository, 4 main folder are presented. 

- the folders *C/C++* contain code based on exercises and examples shown in the textbook **The Audio Programming Book**, by *Richard Boulanger and Victor Lazzarini*. I've studied on this book during my final period of the Bachelor, as a preliminary preparation for the Bachelor thesis. Both folders contain scripts that mainly deal with *audio signal processing*. Especially, most of the scripts are based on chapters *0, 1, 2* as well as chapters *6* (delays) and *7, 8, 9* (spectral signal processing). For further details, see [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book). 

- the folder *Python* contains all the code I wrote during the *Coursera* online course **Audio Signal Processing for Musical Application**, taugth by *Javier Serra* (UPF) and *Julius O. Smith* (Stanford) and taken in Fall 2015. All that course is based on Python, and so are the scripts. The folder starting with *A* plus a number are intented for lectures homework, in a chronological order. The folder *resources* contains all the code developed during the practical lessons. 

- the folder *SuperCollider* contains a personal modified version of most of the example given throughout the book **Introduction to SuperCollider** by *Andrea Valle*, which I have studied between March and June 2015. Further information about the book could be found [here](https://introtoscbook.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/introscsample61.pdf) and [here](http://supercollider.github.io) about the *SuperCollider* programming language.
