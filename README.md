# programming
In this repository, some simple programming examples are given. Particularly, the scripts range from a specific musical and artistic purpose (see *SuperCollider* folder) to a scientific purpose (see *Python* folder). 

All these scripts take place in some self-study and online courses I went through aside from my Bachelor and my Master programmes.

The folder is updated as new scripts take place inside.

## general overview
Inside this repository, 4 main folder are presented. 

- the folders *C/C++* contain code based on exercises and examples shown in the textbook **The Audio Programming Book**, by *Richard Boulanger and Victor Lazzarini*. I've studied on this book during my final period of the Bachelor, as a preliminary preparation for the Bachelor thesis. Both folders contain scripts that mainly deal with *audio signal processing*. Especially, most of the scripts are based on chapters *0, 1, 2* as well as chapters *6* (delays) and *7, 8, 9* (spectral signal processing). For further details, see [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book). 

- the folder *Python* contains all the code I've been writing for some *Coursera* online courses. Particulary, *Audio Signal Processing* refers to [the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) taugth by *Javier Serra* (UPF) and *Julius O. Smith* (Stanford), while *Applied Machine Learning* refers to [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning). 
    Moreover, the script *Chord_recognition* implements a simple model for chord recognition using chroma features and deep learning.
    All the scripts are either in plain Python (2.7/3.5) or in Jupyter.

- the folder *SuperCollider* contains a personal modified version of most of the example given throughout the book **Introduction to SuperCollider** by *Andrea Valle*, which I have studied between March and June 2015. Further information about the book could be found [here](https://introtoscbook.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/introscsample61.pdf) and [here](http://supercollider.github.io) about the *SuperCollider* programming language.
