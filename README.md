# programming
In this repository, some simple programming examples are given. Particularly, the scripts range from a specific musical and artistic purpose (see *SuperCollider* folder) to a scientific purpose (see *Python* folder). 

All these scripts take place in some self-study and online courses I went through aside from my Bachelor and my Master programmes.

## general overview
Inside this repository, 4 main folder are presented. 
- the folders *C/C++* contain code based on exercises and examples shown in the textbook **The Audio Programming Book**, by *Richard Boulanger and Victor Lazzarini*. I've studied on this book during my final period of the Bachelor, as a preliminary preparation for the Bachelor thesis. Both folders contain scripts that mainly deal with *audio signal processing*. Especially, most of the scripts are based on chapters *0, 1, 2* as well as chapters *6* (delays) and *7, 8, 9* (spectral signal processing). For further details, see [here]()
