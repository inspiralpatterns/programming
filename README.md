## purpose
In this repository, some simple programming scripts and snippets are given. Particularly, the scripts range from a specific musical and artistic purpose to a scientific purpose plus some fun (e.g. `bash`). 

## structure
`C/C++`: audio DSP scripts based on exercises and examples from **The Audio Programming Book**, by *Richard Boulanger and Victor Lazzarini* as a preliminary preparation for the Bachelor thesis. Most of the scripts are based on chapters *0, 1, 2* as well as chapters *6* (delays) and *7, 8, 9* (spectral signal processing).

`Python`: code for the *Applied Machine Learning* [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning).
Moreover, the script *Chord_recognition* implements a simple model for chord recognition using chroma features and deep learning.

`SuperCollider`: example snippets with some tweaks from **Introduction to SuperCollider** by *Andrea Valle*.

`haskell`: self-study code and live coding snippets in TidalCycles DSL (inside `/tidal` subfolder).

`max`: snippets on generative techniques for music in Max 8.
